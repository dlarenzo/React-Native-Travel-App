**One to Six Paragraphs of project descriptions here**
This Travel App is designed for users to be able to look at travel destinations around the world. While reviewing via photos, user can click the photo and learn more about the destination (location, duration of stay, persons and ratings).

**Login Authorization**
User will start with a Welcome Screen where they will choose to Login (already a user) or Create User Profile. Authentication with take place. User will not be able to access any information until User Profile create and then they can see the Travel site.

**Authorized Screen with Navigation Tabs below**
After logging in, user will gain access to authorized site screen detailing the following
*Popular Destinations
*Services
*Hot Topics from Travel Selections
*Blog Section (Explore the greatest places of the world)
*Testimonials
*Footer

Some of these items will be held in a bottom Navigation bar to access in different screens

**Goal**
Goal is to connect a backend API of Images and Information about places from around the world to display in the frontend area of the project, providing data that can be mapped through to display the information for user to select to view more, and lead to different areas

**2 Types of storage available.**  
Local machine storage(Axios) meaning the information that user adds will only be remembered while using. Once app has been refreshed the information is lost. Database storage where the information is sent to a database to be stored (MongoDB, Firebase, Appwrite). One of these options will be selected for the use of the information

**Goal to Accomplish**
Combining the Frontend Development with backend usage completing a full stack application. This will provide a smoother user useability and navigation through the site
